## Introduction
This code implements a graphical user interface (GUI) application named "Urban Heat Island Monitor" to visualize and analyze urban heat island (UHI) data.
## Problem
Urban heat islands (UHIs) are urban areas that experience significantly higher temperatures compared to surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon can negatively impact human health, air quality, and energy consumption. This application aims to address the need for a user-friendly tool to monitor and analyze UHI data.
## Proposed Solution
The application provides a user interface for:
* Entering a city name to fetch weather forecast data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
* Simulating UHI data by generating random temperatures for different areas within the city.
* Displaying the UHI effect (temperature difference between urban and rural areas).
* Visualizing the data through various plots:
    * Pie chart: Temperature distribution in urban and rural areas.
    * Spectrum lines graph: Electromagnetic spectrum with random intensities (demonstration).
    * UV graph: Simulated UV intensity over time.
    * ECG effort graph: Simulated green house effort level over time (demonstration).
* Displaying the weather forecast for the next five days.
* Suggesting prevention points based on the UHI effect severity.
## Programming Languages and Technologies Used
* Python: General-purpose programming language for the core functionalities.
* Tkinter: Python library for building the graphical user interface.
* Matplotlib: Python library for generating various plots.
* Pillow (PIL Fork): Python Imaging Library for handling images.
* Requests: Python library for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
## System Requirements
* Operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux (compatible with Python and Tkinter).
* Python 3.x installed.
* Libraries installed: `tkinter`, `matplotlib`, `pillow`, `requests`.
## Python Dependencies
* `tkinter`
* `matplotlib`
* `pillow`
* `requests`
* `numpy` (imported for the ECG plot)
